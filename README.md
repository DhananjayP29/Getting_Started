## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an enthusiastic **AWS Cloud Developer and DevOps aspirant** with a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, system operations, and CI/CD automation. I’ve completed hands-on training in **AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, IAM, CloudWatch)** and DevOps tools like **Docker, Git, Jenkins**, and **Kubernetes**. With a solid educational background in Electronics and IT, I am passionate about designing secure, scalable, and resilient cloud solutions.

I’ve also gained real-world experience through my roles as a **Technical Support Engineer** and an **AWS Graduate Trainee**, where I supported cloud deployments, resolved system issues, and collaborated across teams to maintain uptime and performance. 

Currently, I’m actively building projects like **static website hosting on S3**, **serverless web apps**, and preparing for advanced AWS certifications.
